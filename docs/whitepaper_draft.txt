Abstract

BlockEDU is an alternative education platform and free--and open source--course management system (CMS) where Distributed Open Collaborative Courses (DOCC), Small Private Online Course (SPOC), and institution free traditional Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) or online universites can be explored. The goal of BlockEDU is to solve some of the apparent issues with current online or offline courses in a way that makes quality and reputable education affordable and accessible to all. BlockEDU will offer the ability for anyone to create custom courses or structure degree programs that conform to current academic paths. BlockEDU will remain an uncontrolled non-profit that has no ability to impose any fees on students or educators. 

1 Introduction

Alternative forms of education enabled by the web have become a popular industry in the past decade as students face increasing tutuion rates and the inablity to afford traditional universities. Current instutions have too many auxilary fees that don't benefit the student such as atheletic and adminsistrative fees. With MOOCs you do not need to be geographically close to your institution of learning. As long as the acedemic community has an internet connection and a cursory knowledge of technology they may connect with each other to advance knowledge. Institutions such as Udacity, edX, and Coursera have seen tremendus success as a perhaps viable way of spreading mass education at an affordable price. They promise to offer affordable and accessible information to those who otherwise would not have had a chance to learn. They project themselves toward Goal 4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development where the UN has envisioned a way to ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning.

1.1 Perceived Problems

However, just as there are weaknesses inheret in the current web such as centralization, broken information links, and privacy concerns, there are weaknesses in the current online education systems provided by centralized organizations. Organizations that once started with a non-profit business model have inevietably moved towards instutionalization and profit. 

The ability to use the web to generate mass profit from the crowd is potentially one of the largest weaknesses presented by traditional MOOCs. There is a lack of small class sizes that cater to all types of learning. Without the ablility to create personal interactions between educators and students there are large incompletion rates and only a select few that will succeed from MOOCs. Others will drop off and lose money to a for-profit institution. Large class sizes also limit the ability of the educator to learn better ways of structuring their courses in the future. Personal feedback is a valubale resource for both educator and student.

MOOCs lack a flexibilty that allows the community to decide how coureses should be structured. Some Universities have expressed concern that the massive nature of MOOCs or the need for those involved to understand technology or a lack of a stong sequenced structure makes them unacceptable. They often forget about foreign language speakers and only cater to English as they are not able to coordinate on a local level. These MOOC systems fail to explore the difficulties of relevance and knowledge transfer across boarders. 



1.2 Proposed Solution

While seeminly good ideas such as open edx exist, they are technically complicated to for educators to run and encourage profit to be driven to experts such as edx to set them up.

BlockEDU puts forth an idea that using decentralized technologies can enforce a non-profit model that is self sustaining. Peer-to-peer education will ensure that the community always forms the organization. There will be no centralized authority to dictate how a course should be sized, scheduled, or monetized. Each community member will have the ability to use a system permentaly printed in an immutable ledger that was once used only for financial transactions. Auxilaray p2p systems will offset some the of the costs associated with "blockchains". Privacy and a lack of cencorship are built in to the systems used so that courses will never be limited to the constructs of a few, but rather molded by the masses. Just as massive course structures will be possible so will small localized communites. Ultmately the members of this community get to determine where they belong and what works best for them.

2. Design

BlockEDU will use a combination of the most applicalble decentralized technologies. As these technolgies come into being and work out their growing pains blockEDU will retain the ability to shift its underlying tech stack to that of the best suited. We will begin creating the system by using what is currently available as of the time of writing this whitepaper draft.

2.1 Overview

2.2 Ethereum

Blockchains offer a payment system that is decentralized so that direct payments can be made from educator to student. This helps to disincentivize blockEDU from taking a profit from the system as it has no ability to do so. Smart contracts will be used to generate a payment processor. They will also be used as an immutable database of pointers to the advertisement of upcoming courses. These pointers will ensure that course material remains open and free for all to access at any point in time after their upload to blockEDU. Those who choose to not pay for classed or participate in the course will not be graded or receive feedback, but they will always be able to learn from the course in the future much like MIT opencourses are published to the public.

2.2.1 Payments

Blockchains do one thing well (sometimes) at the current time of writing this. They are a form of decentralized payment processing. While transactions fees and miner centralization are inhereint problemsof succesful chains, idea on scaling are startng to form. One such possibliity that will be explored is micropayment systems and off chain state channels if fees ever become high enough to degrade the cost of savings in the mission statement. BlockEDU courses will only require one-time payyments that will cover a large time frame and be larger in amount. So the risk of losing too much to fees is most likely neglagible.

2.2.1 Course Contracts

Each course that is presented to the CMS by an instructor will be a smart contract living on the ethereum blockchain. The contents of this contract will include a) the duration of the course marked by miner timestamp. (this is acceptable as the length of a course with be longer than 900 ms). b) the course description to be publicized to those interested in taking the course. c) the required prereqs needed on student accounts in order to enroll in the course if any. d) the cose in EDU tokens needed by the student to enroll. e) a sercurity deposit held by the contract submitted by the teacher. (more on this in 2.2.1 b) f) hash links to the actual course material (this requires teacherts prepare the entire coursae before creation).

2.2.1 a Student records contract

A contract will hold the published records of what courses they have passed.

2.2.1 a prereqs

The course contract will be able to read from the student record registry contract to deterimine tif the public key that the student is sending a request to enroll from has completed the apprpriate amount of courses.

2.2.1 b Bonds

Beyond reputation systems that will be publicly available to students before enrolling couraea. There will be a deposit required by eductaors to ensue they deliver as promised. 

2.2.1 c hash linked course material

2.2.1 d courae descript

a unique description that is searchable by the frontend of the CMS inorder for students to find courases they are intereseted in taking,

2.2.2 Reputation

2.2.3 Immutable Database


2.3 IPFS / Swarm

The Interplanetary File system or ethereum swarm system will serve as content addressing netowrk that allows for the offest of on cahin data storgae.

2.3.1 Immutable data pointers

The smart contracts will only store the hash pointers used by the IPFS protcol. When the applications akes a request for some data it will reach out to the ipfs or swarm dht to retreive the content. This allows for large amounts of course data in the for of pdfs, lecture slides, or course videos to be uploaded to the course contract.

2.4 Storj / Sia / Swarm / Filecoin

A netowrk of farmers that can be accesses by the content addresed hashes will garuntee that the course material stays alive in the network, even well beyond the closing of the course if chosen.

2.4.1 Provably retrivable records

All the listed systems use some form of auditing to ensure that files remain in the network that are not popular As courses will not be poular content, especially after they have closed, it is important to have a system that will maintain them for future use as free and open learning materials for others. It will cost a fee from the foundation to keep these records active.

2.4.2 Records controlled by students

The student records of their scores on all exams and total course grades will also be kept on these provably retrivable systems. All of these systems encrypt the data that they store so the student will retain ful lcontrol over who sees their success or faulures.

3. Access

Not everyone can be expected to be able to understand how to use peer-to-peer technologies in their current state. A non-profit organaztion will be formed to help address this problem. POssible centralized services that will need to be provided for a time are fiat payment processing, full-node services such as infura that are able to run the open RPC clients for Eth, IPFS, and Storj, and the application server that will serve the javascript CMS client.

There is no traditional business model to sustain this so alternatives will be explored. From selling t-shirts and taking donations to distributions of organizationed owned ERC20 tokens.

3.1 EDU Tokens

Tokens will be used as the initial and limited continued funding model of this non-profit. The initial sale will be used to fund development to MVP. As all systems require maintainence the non-profit will hold an excess of tokens not sold for future sales to fund further improvements and development. 

3.1.1 Total Supply

An arbitrary total supply of 21 million has be chosen to pay omage to bitcoin.

3.1.2 Token Distribution Process

A total of 4.2 Million EDU tokens will be offered in the ICO phase so that the organization may retain 80% of the total supply for future development. 

A presale discount will be offered to large institutional and personal investors that wish to support blockEDU. A cap will be set at 2 Million EDU for the presale investors wishing to spend $30,000 or more.

The remaining tokens will be held by the non-profit foundation as a method for funding future developnent any centralized costs to aliviate user interaction friction.
